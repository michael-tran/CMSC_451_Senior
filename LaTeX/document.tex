\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product perspective}

Modernizing Vendor Management Across the Enterprise

\subsection{Product functions}

Organizations lack a streamlined process for managing external vendors, which leads to duplicative work performed on the vendor side but also within the organizations themselves. Organizations oftentimes manage vendors using disparate systems that lack work flow automation and reporting/analytics to facilitate a more efficient and accurate vendor management process.\\

There are three aspects for vendor management.
\begin{enumerate}
	
		\item Vendor acquisition: A company or organization needs to have a simple method for vendors to register themselves. The easier the process is, the more willing a vendor will be. There should be a unified form for vendors to complete. The form should envelope all aspects regarding the vendor. The details of the form are included in the data dictionary.
		\item Job selection: Currently, there is no standard for vendors to apply to job postings. For example, there are a different number of requirements for government vs private contracts such as NAICs codes, company information. 
		\item Organization: Currently there is no convenient way to organize current and past vendors/contracts. The plugin will include a role based system for each entity involved. (ex: Vendor, Vendor Manager, Business). The vendor manager will organize the entire contract/vendor acquisition process. 
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Business requirements}

The system should work out-of-the-box for a variety of organizations, such as private companies and governmental agencies. 
A convenient, easy to access tool that makes vendor management/ contract negotiation process streamlined and simple. The tool will include workflow automation, analytics, vendor self-organization, and contract vehicles.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Operating environment}
As ServiceNow is built to be an all-in-one business solution, it does not rely on third-party applications. 
ServiceNow development Is largely based on the built-in GUI based tools such as business rules, client scripts, macros, etc. For more involved tasks, JavaScript is used alongside with Glide Stack, a Web 2.0 development platform written in Java that facilitates development of forms-based workflow applications. The backend database is MySQL.

The application is made in ServiceNow as a plug. The following are the tools being used;
Framework:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ServiceNow \url{https://braviumdemo1.service-now.com/navpage.do}
	\item Angular \url{https://medium.baqend.com/angular-2-by-example-e85a09fa6480}
\end{itemize}
Language:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Java
	\item Html
	\item JS \url{https://javascript.info/}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{User environment}

ServiceNow, the user would enable the plug-in then input all vendor information. Unless needed the user can update the vendor information. Can also import data from other tables. 

\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
	\item	Vendor: provides goods/services to the Business
	\item	Vendor Manager: oversees the vendors and their interactions with the Businesses
	\item	Business: posts jobs and seeks vendors to fulfill contracts  
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraints}
Must be built in the ServiceNow environment.
